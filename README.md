Hello, my name is Ahmed Eladly. I am a postdoctoral researcher in neuroengineering at the University of Manchester.
I am interested in both experimental and computational neuroscience. 
Specifically, I am interested in:

-machine learning and statistical modeling to analyse multivariate electrophysiological time series data.
-computational methods for analysing dynamics and learning the structure of complex neural systems.
- Electrical stimulation and in vivo ephys.

I hold a BSc in pharmacy from Alexandria University, an MSc in Bioengineering from the University College Dublin, and a PhD in ICT from Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
This file will soon contain all the code generated from my postdoc at Manchester....stay tuned :)
