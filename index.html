Hello, my name is Ahmed Eladly. I am a postdoctoral researcher in neuroengineering at the University of Manchester.
I am interested in both experimental and computational neuroscience. 
Specifically, I am interested in:

1) machine learning and statistical modeling for analysing multivariate electrophysiological time series data.
2) computational methods for analysing dynamics and learning the structure of complex neural systems.
3) electrical stimulation and in vivo ephys.
4) Non-linear time series analysis.

I hold a BSc in pharmacy from Alexandria University, an MSc in bioengineering from the University College Dublin, and a PhD in ICT from Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
This space will soon contain all the code generated from my postdoc at Manchester....stay tuned :)
